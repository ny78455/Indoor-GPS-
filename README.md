```

### 1. Frontend (`/frontend`)

* **Technologies**: React 19, Vite, TypeScript, Three.js, TailwindCSS.
* **Responsibility**: Presents the interactive 3D digital laboratory environment. It visualizes normal vectors, light emission cones, mobile receiver vectors, and ray-casted Line-Of-Sight (LOS) obstruction vectors. It synchronizes changes to simulation parameters and shows live simulation logs inside an in-browser retro-monospace console.
* **Vite Configurations**: Proxies `/api` network calls to the Node server (port 3000/3001) during standalone client hot-reloading workouts.

### 2. Backend Server (`/backend`)

* **Technologies**: Axios/Express, TypeScript, esbuild.
* **Responsibility**: Integrates client requests, hosts compiled static SPA files with Vite middleware, and handles core subprocess execution:
  * **YAML Config REST**: Reads/Writes default configuration presets from disk (`VLCL_AI/configs/default.yaml`).
  * **Subprocess Execution Router**: Executed from either root or backend folders, it automatically scans for isolated virtual Python environments (`backend/.venv/bin/python3`) and invokes the simulator engine safely.

### 3. Simulation AI Core (`/backend/VLCL_AI`)

* **Technologies**: Python 3, NumPy, SciPy, PyYAML.
* **Responsibility**: Calculates physical properties of the room and generates logs and 3D digital twin output assets.

## 🔬 Simulation AI Core Architecture

The Python AI core (`/backend/VLCL_AI`) is divided into two highly specialized modules. They work in tandem to create a true digital twin: a fast spatial awareness engine (Module 1), and a rigorous electromagnetic calculation engine (Module 2).

---

### Module 1: The Environment Simulation Engine
**Location**: `/backend/VLCL_AI/environment`

This engine acts as the "director" of the digital twin. It manages spatial awareness, configuration states, and bounding-box level interactions. It focuses on the macroscopic geometry of the room and the progression of time.

#### 1. Room Geometry and Spatial State
The indoor space is defined as a 3D bounding box ($W \times L \times H$). The Simulation Engine handles coordinate mapping and tracking all entities (LEDs, receivers, obstacles) within this grid. It uses simple analytic geometry to compute raw distances and directional vectors between any two points.

#### 2. Mobility and Trajectory Patterns
It controls the kinetic movement of the receiver. Based on predefined models (like `RandomWaypoint`, `Linear`, or `Static`), it calculates velocity, acceleration, and updates the receiver's $(x, y, z)$ position on every time step ($dt$).

#### 3. Bounding-Box Obstacle Intersections
Physical obstacles (like cylinders representing human researchers or rectangular partitions) are tracked by the simulation engine. It performs primary ray-tracing to test if a 3D line segment (from an LED to a receiver) intersects an obstacle's bounding shape. If intersected, the simulation engine flags a **Line-of-Sight (LOS) blockage** for that specific transmission path.

#### 4. Simulation Orchestrator
The `Simulator` class sits here. It manages the lifecycle loop: stepping through frames, updating mobility, gathering the macroscopic state of the `Scene`, and piping this data into either the frontend visualizer or down into the Physics Engine for deep analysis.

---

### Module 2: The High-Fidelity Physics Engine
**Location**: `/backend/VLCL_AI/physics`

While Module 1 handles *where* things are, Module 2 handles *how light behaves* between them. The Physics Engine executes advanced electromagnetic calculations to simulate optical wireless communication channels, acting as a rigorous digital twin of physical optoelectronics.

#### 1. Advanced Transmitter Modeling (Ceiling-Mounted LEDs)
Each LED transmitter acts as a lambertian emitter. The emission radiation profile is characterized by its **Lambertian Order** $m$, calculated from the semi-angle emission beam ($\theta_{1/2}$):

$$
m = \frac{-\ln(2)}{\ln(\cos(\theta_{1/2}))}
$$

The physics engine tracks subcarrier frequency modulation, DC bias, and projects optical radiation down with a specified optical power output ($P_{tx}$).

#### 2. Optoelectronic Receiver Node (Photodiode)
The mobile photodiode platform translates optical power into electrical signals. It evaluates:
* **Active Area ($A_{apd}$)**: Physical capture plane size in $m^2$.
* **Optical Concentrator**: Lenses that amplify incoming signal gain $g(\psi)$ based on the refractive index ($n$).
* **Optical Filter**: Transmission gain $T_s(\psi)$ for specific wavelengths.
* **Responsivity ($R$)**: The conversion efficiency (in A/W) of optical power to electrical current, resulting in a photodiode current: $I_{pd} = R \times P_{rx}$.

#### 3. Geometry and Line-Of-Sight Channel Loss
The Physics Engine calculates the **Lambertian Direct Current Optical Gain ($H(0)$)**:

$$
H(0) = \begin{cases} 
\frac{(m + 1) A_{apd}}{2\pi d^2} \cos^m(\phi) g(\psi) T_s(\psi) \cos(\psi) & \text{if } 0 \le \psi \le \text{FOV} \\ 
0 & \text{if } \psi > \text{FOV} 
\end{cases}
$$

Where:
* $d$: Euclidean distance.
* $\phi$: Angle of irradiance relative to the transmitter normal vector.
* $\psi$: Angle of incidence relative to the receiver normal vector.

#### 4. Multi-path Reflectivity and Raytracing (NLOS)
The physics engine features a dedicated raytracer that tracks Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) reflections. Using surface reflection coefficients ($\rho_W, \rho_C, \rho_F$), it calculates multi-path propagation and impulse delay spread caused by light bouncing off walls and floors before reaching the receiver, maintaining signal integrity even when primary LOS is blocked.

#### 5. Noise Models & Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
It computes physical environmental noises acting upon the receiver hardware:
* **Thermal Noise ($\sigma^2_{thermal}$)**: Generated by the receiver's circuitry, dependent on temperature ($T_k$) and bandwidth ($B$).
* **Shot Noise ($\sigma^2_{shot}$)**: Generated by ambient background light ($P_{bg}$) and the signal itself.

The final electrical **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** output is calculated in decibels (dB):

$$
\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}} = 10 \log_{10}\left( \frac{(R \cdot P_{rx})^2}{\sigma^2_{thermal} + \sigma^2_{shot}} \right)
$$

---

### Module 3: The Communication Engine (DCO-OFDM)
**Location**: `/backend/VLCL_AI/communication`

Module 3 chains directly onto the Physics Engine. Once the frequency-selective optical channel gain is calculated, the Communication Engine simulates the end-to-end digital signal processing (DSP) required to transmit data via light.

#### 1. DCO-OFDM Modulation
Visible light requires real and positive signals. The engine employs **Direct Current Biased Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (DCO-OFDM)**. It maps random bits to QAM constellations, forces Hermitian symmetry on the subcarrier grid to ensure a real-valued time-domain signal, and applies a DC bias to keep the waveform strictly positive before clipping.

#### 2. Digital Transceiver Chain
* **Transmitter**: QAM Modulation → IFFT → Cyclic Prefix Addition → DC Bias & Clipping.
* **Channel Interface**: The resulting electrical waveform is passed through the LED's low-pass frequency response model and convolved with the optical multi-path impulse response from Module 2.
* **Receiver**: ADC Quantization → Synchronization → Cyclic Prefix Removal → FFT → Frequency Domain Equalization (Zero-Forcing or MMSE) → QAM Demodulation.

#### 3. High-Level Telemetry KPIs
The engine outputs live, real-world communication metrics:
* **Bit Error Rate (BER)**: Empirical (simulated bit errors) vs Analytical (Shannon bound).
* **Error Vector Magnitude (EVM)**: Measures the distortion of received QAM symbols on the constellation map.
* **Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR)** and **Clipping Ratio**: Evaluates signal distortion caused by the limited dynamic range of the LEDs.
* **Sum Rate & Spectral Efficiency**: Raw data rates in Mbps and bandwidth efficiency in bps/Hz.

## ⚡ Execution and Interface Commands

The workspace provides workspace-wide scripts via `package.json` to handle installs and builds across both folders:

### 1. Installations

Install dependencies for both frontend and backend sub-packages in one command:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Running local Development Server

To launch the integrated server (Express serving hot-reloading client via middleware):

```bash
npm run dev
# Or run on an alternative port:
PORT=3001 npm run dev
```

### 3. Setup Virtual Environment (Recommended for Simulator Backend)

To isolate dependencies for the Python simulation engine:

```bash
# 1. Create venv inside public backend root
python3 -m venv backend/.venv

# 2. Install numpy, scipy, loguru, rich, plotly
backend/.venv/bin/pip install -r backend/VLCL_AI/requirements.txt
```

The server will automatically route simulation requests to the virtual environment once `.venv` is present on disk.

### 4. Build Targets

To generate optimized production bundles:

```bash
# Build React static files and Node server script
npm run build
```

* Frontend files are built into `frontend/dist/`.
* Backend is compiled into `backend/dist/server.cjs` by **esbuild**.
